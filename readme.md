## installment

On GitHub, click the "code" button on the top and get the web URL.
then, on your terminal, enter your directory of choice and enter:

```bash
git clone COPIED-URL
```

Next, change directory and enter the downloaded file and install dependencies:

```bash
cd weather-app
npm install
```

Run using expo, and run the expo app on Android:

```bash
npx expo start
```

(iOS works too, but the UI design is optimized for Android)
