This is a [ReactNative](https://reactnative.dev/) weather application project for our Mobile Applications course.

Uses [NativeWind](https://nativewind.dev/) for styling.

## installment

On your terminal, enter your directory of choice and enter:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BurritoAndCoffee/mobile-application-project.git
```

Next, change directory by entering the downloaded file and install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Run using expo, and run the expo app on Android:

```bash
npx expo start
```

(iOS works too, but the UI design is optimized for Android)
